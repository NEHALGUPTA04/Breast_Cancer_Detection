# Breast_Cancer_Detection

### Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. There were over 2.3 million new cases in 2020, making it a significant health problem in the present day.

### The key challenge in breast cancer detection is to classify tumors as malignant or benign. Malignant refers to cancer cells that can invade and kill nearby tissue and spread to other parts of your body. Unlike cancerous tumors (malignant), Benign does not spread to other parts of the body and is safe somehow. Deep neural network techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis significantly.

### Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called an artificial neural network.


### I have loaded the dataset from sklearn.datasets. I used deep learning model for predicting whether the cancer is Malignant or Benign using neural networks

### The model consists of input layer with single or multiple hidden layers and lastly the output layer of neural network. The output layer will be our result (predicted value) that whether the cancer  is Malignant or Benign.
